This method returns string description of an object.

Using a class inside a class and how objects interact with each other.


Class inheritence:

A---B,c ---D

Method resolution order -- going from left to right in class definition and follows breadth first search

When a class is inherited from multiple clasess, methods and attributes will search in MRO following Breadth first search


Abstraction:
For a subclass to have its own implementation of a method.
Create a abstract method in parent class, so that you cannot create a subclass object without defining the method
